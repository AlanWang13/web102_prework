## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the challenges I faced while building that app was the relearning process of Javascript becuase I haven't used it in many months. I've have been soley using Python for a few months and one habit I learned from python was the lack of semi-colons in the code. This tripped me up in the beggining because I was so used pressing 'enter' after every line without a semicolon before hand. However the more challenges I did the more natural it became when it came to semi-colon use.
